            <p class="ml-3">
              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
              environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
              connected to the objects of its environment to provide
              programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>

            <ul class="ml-5">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                  objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                  (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
                  application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
                  user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                  navigation.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                  objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
                  example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                  communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                  from one invocation to another of the application, or perform
                  file manipulations on a server.
                </p>
              </li>

          <section id="javascriptAndJava">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-2">JavaScript and Java</h3>
            <p class="ml-3">
              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java
              but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
              small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
              string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
              instead of the more common class-based object model. The
              prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what
              is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
              supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
              Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
              methods.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do
              not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do
              not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
              or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
              Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
              explicitly typed.

            <h3 class="pt-2">Hello World</h3>
            <p class="ml-3 pt-2">
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
              write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <p class="ml-5">
              <code

          <section id="variables">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-2">Variables</h3>
            <p class="ml-3">
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
              or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits
              (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
              through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
              identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="declareVariable">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-2">Declaring variables</h3>
            <p class="ml-3">You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p class="ml-3">With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <p class="ml-5"><code>var x = 42.</code></p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              This syntax can be used to declare both local and global
              variables.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <p class="ml-5"><code>x = 42.</code></p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
              JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <p class="ml-5"><code> let y = 13.</code></p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
              See Variable scope below.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="variableScope">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-2">Variable scope</h3>
            <p class="ml-3">
              When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called
              a global variable, because it is available to any other code in
              the current document. When you declare a variable within a
              function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
              only within that function.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
              scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
              function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
              example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is
              the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not
              the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-5">
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced
              in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-5">
              <code
                >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y
                is not</code
              >
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px"><code>defined</code></p>
          </section>

          <section id="globalVariable">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-3">Global variables</h3>
            <p class="ml-3">
              Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In
              web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access
              global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one
              window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the
              window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
              phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
              variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="constant">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-3">Constants</h3>
            <p class="ml-3 pt-1">
              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
              The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
              and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-5"><code>const PI = 3.14;</code></p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
              re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized
              to a value.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
              scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
              is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
              variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>
            <p class="ml-5">
              <code
                >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; //
                THIS WILL</code
              >
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px">
              <code
                >CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements</code
              >
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px"><code>}</code></p>
          </section>

          <section id="dataType">
            <h3 class="pb-2 pt-3">Data types</h3>
            <p class="ml-3">
              &#0149; The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px">&#9725; Boolean. true and false.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px">
              &#9725; null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
              JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL,
              or any other variant.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px">
              &#9725; undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px">&#9725; Number. 42 or 3.14159.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px">&#9725; String. "Howdy"</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 100px">
              &#9725; Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose
              instances are unique and immutable.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-3">&#0149; and Object</p>
            <p class="ml-3">
              Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they
              enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.
              Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the
              language. You can think of objects as named containers for values,
              and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
