              disease <br />
              resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
              climate on Earth.

              <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
              wheat with a high-yeidling <br />
              American breed, creating a strain that responds well to

              provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

              food supply by 2050." Argues <br />
              that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the
              demand, as <br />
              we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
              dangerous <br />
              because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a
              long <br />
              time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
              best breeds."
